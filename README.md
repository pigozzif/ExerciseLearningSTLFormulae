# ExerciseLearningSTLFormulae
In this repository you can find the code necessary for the required exercise on learning STL formulae.

You should:
* clone it into your local machine;
* all dependencies are already managed by the `pom.xml` file, and will be downloaded automatically by Maven (with the exception of one, whose .jar is contained in `libs` and will be linked automatically as well);
* head to the `ExampleLearning.java` file, which contains the main learning loop.
